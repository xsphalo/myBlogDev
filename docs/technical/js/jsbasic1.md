# Javascript基础部分

If my template can't meet your requirement, you can further create your own template.

## JS-1
### JS-1-1
Before you start building your own template, you should gather some knowledge.

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)

Actually, you don't have to learn the whole Vue.js. Html and CSS are more essential.
### JS-1-2
By looking at the `.vue` files I provided, you should understand how the `.vue` file works.

Read [VuePress Guide](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/) and understand how VuePress is capable of.

## JS-2

The components, which are the templates used in this site, are separate `.vue` files under `.vuepress/components` directory.

For example, the `MarkdownCard.vue` is a widget used in the projects page. The `Homepage.vue` is a layout that could be further customized.

For more information, check VuePress doc on [Custom Layout for Specific Pages](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/default-theme-config/#custom-layout-for-specific-pages).


## JS-3

You can override styles with `.vuepress/override.styl`. Adding simple CSS rules to control how the elements appear on your site.

Check [Simple CSS Override](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/default-theme-config/#simple-css-override) for more help.

## JS-4

You need to know more about Vue and Javascript. :smile:

Learn and create! :muscle:
